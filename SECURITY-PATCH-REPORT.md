## Fixes Applied

### 🔴 Critical — All Resolved

| ID | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| C-1 | Anon full read/write/delete on `orders` | Dropped 3 broad policies. Anon: INSERT only. Authenticated: read own rows (`auth.uid()::text = customer_id`). Admin mutations routed through `/api/admin/orders` (service role key). `updateOrder`/`deleteOrder` in `supabase-store.js` now call the API endpoint instead of direct Supabase client. |
| C-2 | Anon could read all profiles + escalate `role='admin'` | Dropped `Anon read all profiles`, `Anon update profiles`. Anon: INSERT only (signup). Authenticated: owner-only (`auth.uid() = id`). Admin reads in `api/admin/_auth.js` already use service role key — unaffected. |
| C-3 | Any authenticated user could write `products`/`categories` | Dropped `Auth all products` / `Auth all categories`. Both roles: SELECT only. Admin writes exclusively via `/api/admin/products` (service role key). |

### 🟠 High — All Resolved

| ID | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| H-1 | In-memory rate limiting resets on cold start | Created `api/_ratelimit.js` — persistent `rate_limits` Supabase table + `check_rate_limit()` SECURITY DEFINER RPC (in `supabase-setup.sql`). `api/verify-captcha.js` and `api/admin/auth.js` now use this. In-memory Map retained as fallback when Supabase is unreachable. |
| H-2 | `ADMIN_EMAIL` exposed in browser bundle (`js/env.js`) | Removed `ADMIN_EMAIL` from `build.js` env object and output template. `EMAILJS_ADMIN_EMAIL` (different purpose) retained. |
| H-3 | `unsafe-inline` in `script-src` CSP | Computed SHA-256 hashes for all 20 inline scripts across 38 HTML files. Replaced `'unsafe-inline'` in `vercel.json` with the full set of `'sha256-...'` hashes. |

### 🟡 Medium — All Resolved

| ID | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| M-1 | No body size limit before buffering in `api/admin/upload.js` | Added early `Content-Length` header check before any buffering. Added streaming byte-counter that calls `req.destroy()` if limit exceeded mid-stream. Returns HTTP 413 in both cases. |
| M-2 | `X-Powered-By: ZenMarket` fingerprinting header | Removed from `_headers`. |
| M-3 | PayHere IPN uses MD5 | Merchant ID validation already present. No action — PayHere protocol limitation. |
| M-4 | Anon SELECT on `newsletter_subscribers`, `blog_posts`, `reviews` | Newsletter: removed anon SELECT (only INSERT retained). Blog posts: anon reads published only. Reviews: anon reads approved+non-rejected only. |

### 🟢 Low — No Change Needed

| ID | Status |
|---|---|
| L-1 | Client-side brute-force in localStorage is UX-only layer; server-side in place. Comment retained. |
| L-2 | `DEMO_MODE=false` guard confirmed correct in `build.js`. Verify Vercel dashboard. |

| `api/admin/orders.js` | Added DELETE handler for single + bulk (C-1) |
| `api/admin/upload.js` | Early Content-Length + streaming byte-counter guard (M-1) |
| `js/supabase-store.js` | `updateOrder`/`deleteOrder`/`deleteOrders` now call `/api/admin/orders` via fetch (C-1) |
| `js/admin-api.js` | Added `orders.delete()` + `orders.deleteBulk()` methods (C-1) |
| `js/admin/admin-orders.js` | Mutations use `AdminAPI.orders.*` instead of store-adapter direct (C-1) |
| `build.js` | Removed `ADMIN_EMAIL` from browser bundle output (H-2) |

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Run `supabase-setup.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor (safe to re-run)
- [ ] Deploy updated serverless functions to Vercel
- [ ] Confirm `DEMO_MODE=false` in Vercel Environment Variables
- [ ] Confirm `ADMIN_EMAIL` removed from any cached `js/env.js` (redeploy triggers rebuild)
- [ ] Verify CSP hashes work — open browser console, look for CSP violations after deploy
- [ ] Set `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in Vercel env (needed by new rate limiter)
